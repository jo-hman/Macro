# Macro
is a Java 11 and JavaFX desktop application for recording and performing macros on chosen files.

I created it for bookkeeping teams in a company I was working for in order to get rid of repetitive tasks like opening excel sheets every morning just to fetch most recent data from a database and then transforming those sheets so that they could work with them as intended.
This application gets this sort of stuff done. It can run in the background and open chosen files at a chosen hour(e.g. 5 am so that it doesnt interupt anybody) and perform recorded macros by yourself.
